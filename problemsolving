Strategies.

Define what an algorithm is
devise a plan to solve algorithms
compare and contrast problem solving patterns
including frequency counters two pointer problems
and divide and conquer


An algorithm 

a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

almost everything you do in programming involves
some kind of algorithm
foundation for being a scucessful problem solving and developer

1.) Devise a plan for solving problems.
2.) Master common problem solving patterns.


- understand the problem.
- explore concrete examples.
- break it down.
- solve/simplify problem.
- look back and refactor.

Can I restate the problem in my own words
what are the inputs that go into the problems
what are the outputs that should come from the solution

can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
Do I have enough information to solve the problem

how should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem.

//
    Write a function which takes two numbers and return their sum
 
can you check the result?
can you derive the result differently?
can you understand it at a glance?
can you use the result or method for some other problem?
can you improve the performance of your solution?
can you think of other ways to refactor?
how have other people solved this problem?
